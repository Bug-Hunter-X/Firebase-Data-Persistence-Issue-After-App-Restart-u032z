In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't persisting correctly across different sessions.  My code appeared to successfully write data to the Realtime Database using `set()`, but when the app was closed and reopened, the data wouldn't be there. I confirmed the data was written by checking the Firebase console, and the rules were correctly configured to allow read/write access for authenticated users.  The issue only occurred when the app was closed and reopened.
